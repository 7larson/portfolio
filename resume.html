        <h2>Resume</h2>
        
        <p class="work">My name is Seven Larson and I am an illustrator, graphic designer, and web designer. With some small personal and private freelance projects under my belt, I also have former work experience in other fast-paced environments, both on individual tasks and as an integral part of a team! I have been recognized for my ability to notice patterns where others don't to solve problems before they occur. One small thing I pride myself on is my fast and accurate typing skills!<br /><br /></p>

        <h2>What I won't draw</h2>
        <p class="work">Generally speaking I'll draw any character that is safe for work and I'm alright drawing tasteful nudity as well. I'm okay with drawing characters in armor, I'm fine with drawing anthropomorphic characters (sometimes known as furries), and I am willing to try drawing some mechs! I am not comfortable drawing art of an explicit nature, art that heavily features gore, or any art that is offensive or bigoted. I won't draw racist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. work.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p class="work">Payment must be paid in full prior to the commission work begins via Paypal. I will send you an invoice. All prices are in US Dollars. If you need a refund, I only offer them during the sketching stage. After I've confirmed the sketch with you and begun work on the rest of the piece, I can no longer offer refunds due to the nature of how much work has gone into the piece. For sketch-only commissions, I can only offer refunds up until the sketch is completed, so you have a very short window - once it's done, it's done. Please be positive you want to commission me before doing so! If for whatever personal reason I am unable to finish your commission, I will provide a refund.</p>
        
        <h2>Extra Fees</h2>
        <p class="work">If this is a private commission, such as a gift for someone or a personal commission that is sensitive and meaningful just for you, and you do not want me to post on social media, put it in my portfolio, or stream it to Twitch, there is an additional 15% fee given that I will not be able to use the result to market my work.</p>
        
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p class="work">When you are commissioning me, please be sure to send me all the necessary details I will need to complete your commission up front. I will need to know what type of commission you want, accurate references for your character, information about what expression and pose you would like them in, what kind of background you would like if you are getting one, etc. You are free to leave it up to my artistic freedom if you are not sure, but I do not offer major structural changes to the pose of the character, positioning of background, etc. so keep this in mind. After I send you the sketch you are allowed to request small edits (for example, a slight change to facial expression, more whippy hair, an edit to the placement of a piece of jewelry, etc.) twice (I will make the first edits, show you, then you can request edits once more). When I add rough color you may request changes to the colors. Beyond these stages, no other edits can be made.<br><br>
        Note: If your character has a very complex design I may need to ask if something can be simplified, I am very flexible on this and willing to work with complicated outfits as best I can! I will inform you before accepting your commission and we can discuss if I think an aspect may need simplification.</p>
        
        <h2>Turnaround</h2>
        <p class="work">A single commission will be finished in no more than 2 months from the date you pay (though it likely will be finished before then). If you are ordering more than one at a time, though it is unlikely, I may need to adjust this timeline and will discuss this with you at the time of your commission inquiry. If you have a deadline you need the work for, please let me know in advance so we can discuss if this is something I can meet.</p>
        
        <h2>What You Receive</h2>
        <p class="work">You will receive the digital file in full-resolution PNG format. Generally they are best for displaying online, or printing at sizes up to 8x10" at 300dpi. As each character is different and each pose may require a different amount of space, I do not work within a set aspect ratio, so premade print-sizes or frame sizes may not work for a physical print without cropping the image somewhat. I formerly worked in a print lab and as a custom-framer so if you are interested in getting it printed and framed, feel free to let me know and I can let you know what I would recommend.</p>
        
        <h2>Usage Rights</h2>
        <p class="work">The commission you receive, unless otherwise agreed upon, is for personal use only. You are not granted rights to print the image on merchandise except for yourself and are <b>not</b> allowed to upload it to third-party print sites like Redbubble. Unless it is a private commission you paid an extra fee for as outlined above, I reserve the right to post your commission on my social media, portfolios, etc. for my marketing. If you have commissioned fanart, I would love to ask if I can sell prints as well, but you are free to decline!</p>

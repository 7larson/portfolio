        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="work">Hi there! I'm Seven, yes like the number, but you can call me Sev. I'm 27 and I live in a little suburb of St. Paul called Eagan with my partner and our two cats, Bast and Mulder. I do freelance work as an illustrator, graphic designer, and web designer. I'm a bit of a jack of all trades! I used to also run my own Etsy store, and did my own product creation, inventory, product staging & photography, marketing, social media management, sales, and more. Woof, that sounds like a lot doesn't it? It was!</p>
        
        <p class="work">I got my starts as an artist at the age of 4, when I decided I wanted to be an artist. I kept it up as a hobby through my whole life, even despite learning I have aphantasia, meaning I cannot picture things in my head which makes art a lot harder! I took every art course my high school offered (which was a total of 9 art courses including one college-level self-motivated course complete with portfolio reviews). I started in graphic & web design on Neopets of all places, way back when I was 11 years old. Believe it or not, Neopets had a system in place where you could create "pet pages", and you could go wild with HTML and CSS within a couple of limitations. You couldn't use any hotlinks that led off of Neopets outside of images, but other than that, you could do pretty much whatever you wanted, including adding images, text, and even music for awhile. I used to make all kinds of cool pages for pets, characters, art galleries, and more. From there I moved on to other kinds of profile customization for websites like Myspace, and eventually started creating my own websites for fun. I took web design courses in high school in which my teacher, Mrs. Salvevold, roped me into helping out, which I hated to admit I enjoyed too. I've since turned it into something I do as a career from home!</p>
        
        <p class="work">In my free time, I love to do fanart and I also write. I love The X-Files, Final Fantasy 7, and The Last of Us. I enjoy playing tabletop RPGs such as Dungeons of Dragons and Chronicles of Darkness (World of Darkness is neat, but what can I say, Geist: The Sin Eaters is the most compelling setting I've read out of the greater series and The God Machine as a concept is pretty dang cool) and normal board games too! I listen to a huge variety of music, I love tuna casserole and Taco Bell, and ever since I started taking Topamax I am absolutely shattered that I can no longer drink root beer. I am a bit of a witchy wonder, I experience frequent existential dread (don't we all), and I am the picture of "millenial" in the dictionary. All jokes aside, I am trans, disabled, and an activist, and incorporate all of those factors into everything I do. My work is extremely important to me.</p>

        <p>Hi there! I'm Seven, yes like the number, but you can call me Sev. I'm 30 and I live the Twin Cities metro area of Minnesota with my partner and our three cats, Mulder, Bast, and Jolly.</p>
        
        <p>I've been writing and pursuing it as a potential career with varying levels of seriousness since I was a child. In 2011, I majored in Literature & Communications at Minnesota State University Moorhead, though due to life circumstances I was unable to complete my education. Since then, I've continued writing in my free time as much as I can.</p>

        <p>In 2021, 10 years after I first aspired to get into the gaming industry, I started working as a QA professional with Activision Publishing, and my time in QA has been incredibly invaluable in showing me how games get made, and how different disciplines come together to get it done. I love my job as a QA Tester, and if not for knowing my passions lie elsewhere, I wouldn't hesitate to make my home in the field. Hopefully, though, on to new, exciting opportunities!<br><br><br></p>

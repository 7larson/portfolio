        <div id="about">
        <p>Hi there! I'm Seven, yes like the number, but you can call me Sev. I'm 30 and I live the Twin Cities metro area of Minnesota with my partner and our three cats, Mulder, Bast, and Jolly.</p>
        
        <p>In 2021, 10 years after I first aspired to get into the gaming industry, I started working as a QA professional with Activision Publishing, and my time in QA has been incredibly invaluable in showing me how games get made, and how different disciplines come together to get it done. Though some see QA as no more than a minimum-wage stepping stone to other careers, I firmly believe that Quality Assurance is an important field in its own right that should be sustainable. Having knowledgeable and experienced QA Testers is an important factor to understanding your players and the game's needs. I worked with Activision until 2024, and am now looking for other QA opportunities in the industry.<br><br><br></p>
